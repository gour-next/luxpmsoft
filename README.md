The project developed in MVVM pattern. So, that UI remain decoupled from main business logic. We can change the UI wihtout much affecting the businees logic.

Now, I have followed SOLID principle. Also, tried to make it protocol orient where ever its possible. Used OOP concept too. Check Forgot password flow.

Also, netwrok call/interaction are not depend on any class/struct but depend on protocol. This gave us felixible to change network client as our wish without affecting businnes logic on any model/viewModel.


Note:

Check this project in any simulator. I havn't handled keyboard interaction(for OTP field press return button from simulator keyboard). Also, the OTP filed design also left. Since, those are developed on decoupled way, so that any design change will not affect other.
